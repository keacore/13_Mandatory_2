# 13 Mandatory Assignment 2
Description of the second mandatory assignment

In this assignment you have to show Claus a project that includes the elements that we covered during this semester. Then we talk about it for aproximately 10 minutes, and you will get feedback on what is good and what you should practice more before the exam.
This is the point of the assignment. See it as an opotunity to test if you understand everything before the exam. If you do not understand everything the only cosequense is that you will become aware about that. No more severe punishment will occour :)

How to pass the assignment:
* You should not hand anything in!
* You should show up and show Claus something
